class HookBase:
    """
    Base class for hooks that can be registered with :class:`TrainerBase`.
    Each hook can implement 6 methods. The way they are called is demonstrated
    in the following snippet:
    .. code-block:: python
        hook.before_train()
        for _ in range(start_epoch, max_epoch):
            hook.before_epoch()

                hook.after_step()
            hook.after_epoch()
        hook.after_train()
    Notes:
        1. In the hook method, users can access `self.trainer` to access more
           properties about the context (e.g., current iteration).
        2. A hook that does something in :meth:`before_step` can often be
           implemented equivalently in :meth:`after_step`.
           If the hook takes non-trivial time, it is strongly recommended to
           implement the hook in :meth:`after_step` instead of :meth:`before_step`.
           The convention is that :meth:`before_step` should only take negligible time.
           Following this convention will allow hooks that do care about the difference
           between :meth:`before_step` and :meth:`after_step` (e.g., timer) to
           function properly.
